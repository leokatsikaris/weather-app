# weather-app


Hi everyone! 

This is my very first React app. Was created using HTML and CSS. 

It's a simpl app that takes the data from OpenWeatherMap API and shows the weather from searched cities. Can also bring a detailed info by clicking on city name, and delete the city from home site if you want to. 

Hope you like it! I'm very open to constructive comments and opinions. 



IMPORTANT! 
To execute the app type "npm start" on the main directory and wait your browser to open the website.
